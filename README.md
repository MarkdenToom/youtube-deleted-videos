## General info
This project is a web extension that creates a snapshot of a youtube playlist and tells you the titles of videos that have been deleted, made private or removed. It will only work will for videos that have been deleted after the snapshot was created.

The standout feature of this project is its ability to automatically find the name of deleted videos without fail and it's set & forget nature. To achieve this, a copy of a playlist is saved locally and compared to the playlist whenever you open it again.
